# Plotting
In this plot gallery you can find plots that are often used in our working group and that can serve as inspiration. Enjoy!

# A short How To
- Create an Rmd file that generates the plot you would like to add to the plot gallery, using sample data
- Remember to comment the code well and make it as reproducible as possible (if you have time for the latter)
- Upload the Rmd file, the sample dataset and a png/jpg file of the plot in this repo
- Add the plot to this README.md and write down what Rmd-file and data belong to it
- To edit this README.md, click on the pencil in the upper right corner of this file
- You can add the plot here by customizing this command (wrap the command with <>): img src="https://github.com/LonsdorfLab/Plotting/blob/main/NameOfThePlot.png" width="..."/
- Let everyone know what you have added to the plot gallery via slack
- If you have any problems, feel free to contact Maren
